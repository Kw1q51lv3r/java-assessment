**What did you like about this Project?**  
I like this project because it's a good primer in teaching us how to implement data storage and retrieval within the back-end or even within embedded systems, as well as throwing a little bit in about exception handling. I feel like if I took the time to understand and master this project, I might be able to program my own microcontrollers for my own projects in the future.

**What did you struggle with in this project?**  
Completing it. I was sick, which meant that I was less alert and less sharp than I would've been otherwise, and having to both juggle between mental rest and task completion, and refreshing my own knowledge of Java, meant that the already-slim time limit was more than tight.

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**  
Maybe if I had two months to learn Java and the opportunity to build my own microprojects and applets instead of the two weeks I got before having this as my first portfolio project in the language .
